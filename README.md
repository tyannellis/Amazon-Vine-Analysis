## Summary 

- There is no obvious bias of the 5 star ratings. There are more 5 star rating for the reviews that aren't from vine than those that are from vine. 

- For further research I would recommend repeating this analysis for 1 star reviews to see if there are more not vine 1 star reviews compared to the vine reviews.
